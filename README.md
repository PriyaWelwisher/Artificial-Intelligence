  # Moving Object Detection System using WEB CAM
    This Python code implements a real-time moving object detection system using a webcam, leveraging OpenCV and imutils libraries. It captures frames continuously, converts them to grayscale, and applies Gaussian blur to reduce noise. The first frame is used as a reference to detect motion by comparing it with subsequent frames using absolute difference. Thresholding and dilation are applied to enhance the detected motion areas. Contours are identified, and moving objects are counted if they exceed a predefined size. Rectangles are drawn around the detected objects, and the count, along with a status message ("Moving Object Detected" or "Normal"), is displayed both on the video feed and in the shell window. The program runs in a loop, terminating when the 'q' key is pressed, and releases the camera and closes all windows thereafter.
